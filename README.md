A half adder is a digital circuit that performs binary addition on two input bits, providing two outputs: the sum (S) and the carry (C). It is called a "half" adder because it can only handle the addition of two bits without considering any carry from previous stages.

**Inputs:**
- **A and B:** Binary input bits that you want to add.

**Outputs:**
- **Sum (S):** Represents the least significant bit of the binary sum.
- **Carry (C):** Represents the carry-out, indicating whether there is a carry to the next higher bit.

**Truth Table:**

| A | B | S | C |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
